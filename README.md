# Medical Surge Radar: Executive Forecasting Tool

## Overview
Planning for massive, multi-jurisdictional events requires anticipating sudden shifts in patient volume, crowd dynamics, and environmental threats. The Medical Surge Radar is a high-impact forecasting dashboard that translates complex epidemiological models into instant visual intelligence. Designed specifically for emergency managers and medical command staff, it allows leadership to rapidly stress-test regional healthcare capacity.

## Core Capabilities
* **Mass Gathering Medical Surge Modeling:** Dynamic scenario parameters allow users to instantly manipulate independent variables—including attendance volume, temperature, and venue type—to model shifting event conditions.
* **Asset Distribution Waterfall:** Provides a clear, visual deflection strategy. It breaks down the total generated patient load into actionable operational categories: On-Site Treatment In Place (STIP), Alternate Care Sites/Telehealth, and inevitable Emergency Department transports.
* **Regional NEDOCS Threat Gauge:** Translates raw patient transport data into a standardized operational threat score (National Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale). Command staff can monitor the dial in real-time to pinpoint the exact environmental or volume thresholds that will trigger grid saturation.

## Technical Stack
* **Frontend/Framework:** Streamlit
* **Data Visualization:** Plotly
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
